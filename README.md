This repo presents the design and implementation of a high-speed Li-Fi-based text communication system. The system employs a laser LED as the transmitter and a photodiode as the receiver, interfaced with Arduino microcontrollers. A custom 6-bit binary encoding, derived from a 6-level binary tree, replaces the standard ASCII encoding to improve data through-put. Additionally, hardware improvements, including replacing the LDR with a photodiode and the regular LED with a laser LED, significantly enhanced transmission distance, accuracy, and speed. The final system successfully transmits English text over a distance of up to 30 meters during testing, with high reliability and speedâ€”and it is likely capable of even greater ranges under optimal conditions.
